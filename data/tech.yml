    name  : "Geometric Deep Learning"
    quote : > 
            Cutting-edge deep learning technique that models proteins and other molecules in 3D space with the necessary symmetry in "mind". We develop powerful GDL methods to dive deep into protein structures.

    name  : "Property Optimization"
    quote : > 
            A designed protein needs multiple properties to become practical. Our best-in-class strategy excels at optimizing multiple properties to generate a desired protein or therapeutic antibody.
